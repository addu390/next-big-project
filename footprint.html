						<h3 style="font-size: 2em;">Ecological Footprint</h3><br>
						<p style="text-align: left;">
							Let's talk about our ecological footprint and how to reduce our footprint here on Earth. Being a part of this system, the very existence, the western world, we tend to leave behind a huge footprint without any easy options to reduce it. <br> <br>

							While the bigger goal is to change the way we live. A good start would be to use cleaner transportation, use renewable sources of energy to your house and cultivate energy-saving habits, reduce your food footprint, and, most importantly, save as much water as you can! <br> <br>

							I will write a different blog post and add references to good content out there for best practices, but in this post, I want to specifically focus on what companies around me can do to support this cause. <br> <br> 
						</p>

						<h3 style="font-size: 2em;">Amazon</h3>
						<p style="text-align: left;">On the right is a screen from the Amazon IOS application to choose a delivery speed after the checkout screen and delivery address selection. <br> <br> 

							I often see an option to choose a later date, along with a cashback, most likely - this is because there's already a package to be delivered on a later date. If that is true, the customer did contribute to reducing the carbon footprint of Amazon. <br> <br>

						Rather than tracking an individual's carbon footprint, what if we can track the carbon footprint reduced by an individual. On the left is the screen I suggest, where the customer is appreciated for reducing the carbon footprint, a badge and score along with it would be a bonus, and maybe a CASHBACK too? <br><br>

						<h3 style="font-size: 2em;">OLA Cabs</h3>
						<p style="text-align: left;">On the left is the OLA Cabs IOS application home screen <br> <br> On to the right is an example illustration for emphasizing the carbon footprint score; I've informed the customer that picking a "mini" at this point of time would be ideal for reducing carbon footprint as compared to "Prime Sedan" (Would be of a lower score or a badge) - A higher score translating to a lower carbon footprint can be the other way around. <br> <br>

						Clearly, this seems unfair for Sedan and SVN drivers, but giving a score depends on several aspects such as mileage, time to reach the pick-up point, number of people, availability, among others.  <br><br>

					<p style="text-align: left;">This applies to a lot of Companies out there, to name a few: <br>Micro mobility - Yulu <br>Bike Rentals - Bounce & Vogo <br>Delivery - Dunzo, Zomato, Swiggy <br>Ride Sharing - OLA, Rapido & QuickRide<br><br> What if all of the scores and badges are maintained by a common service provider, allowing the end user to visualise the overall reduction in carbon footprint. </p>
